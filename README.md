# `moldable`

A CLI tool for code generation under the influence of [plop](https://plopjs.com) and [scaffdog](https://scaff.dog). It has the best of each tool, yet it is faster and more flexible.
See the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) for more information.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g moldable
```

## Quick Start

Create a `.moldable` folder in the root directory of your application, and create Markdown file within it shown below. Name the file `quick-start.md`.

````md
---
name: "quick-start"
description: "Quick Start"
prompts:
  - type: "base"
    name: "name"
    message: "Type your name"
    validate: "{{if eq (len .input) 0}}Name must have more than - characters{{end}}"
  - type: "select"
    name: "favoriteColor"
    message: "Select your favorite color"
    choices:
      - "Red"
      - "Green"
      - "Blue"
actions:
  - type: "add"
    path: "src/quick-start.json"
    template: "quick-start.json"
---

# quick-start.json

```json
{
  "name": "{{.name}}",
  "favoriteColor": "{{.favoriteColor}}"
}
```
````

Execute `moldable` in the root directory of your application, and select the Generator you want to use.

```bash
# Answer the questions
? Select Generator:
  â–¸ quick-start - Quick Start

âœ”  Type your name : John Doeâ–ˆ

?  Select your favorite color :
  â–¸ Red
    Green
    Blue

# Results
ðŸ–¨  Added:
  src/quick-start.json
```

Answer the questions that appear, and the code will be generated in the `quick-start.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "favoriteColor": "Red"
}
```

## Advanced Usage

You can describe a generator for generating any code.
Create a `/.moldable` folder in the root directory of your application,
and create Markdown files within it.

```
.
â””â”€â”€  .moldable
    â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md
    â””â”€â”€ bar.md
```

The name of the Markdown file corresponds to the Generator name displayed when you launch moldable.
When you run moldable, an interactive question starts according to the selected Generator, and when all are answered, code is generated.
This Generator is divided into metadata (in YAML format) and content (in Markdown format).
The structure of the metadata is as follows. Some properties can use the syntax of Go's [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

| Name        | Description                                                                   | Required           | Type             | Example                                                                                                      |

| prompts     | Questions to be asked sequentially after selecting a template                 | :white_check_mark: | Array of mapping | <pre>type: "base"<br>name: "name"<br>message: "Type a page name"<br></pre>                                   |
| actions     | Settings for generating code using the values of the answers to the questions | :white_check_mark: | Array of mapping | <pre>type: "add"<br>path: "src/app/{{.name}}/page.tsx"<br>template: "{{.name \| pascal}}/page.tsx"<br></pre> |

The structure of each element of the prompts value is as follows.

| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                            | Required                                  | Type                                             |

The structure of each element of the actions value is as follows.

| Name     | Description                                                               | Required                   | Type                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| type     | Type of code generation                                                   | :white_check_mark:         | "add" \| "append"     |
| path     | Destination of the code output                                            | :white_check_mark:         | String(text/template) |
| template | Template name for code generation (must match the heading in the content) | :white_check_mark:         | String(text/template) |
| skip     | Place to skip code generation                                             |                            | String(text/template) |
| pattern  | Destination to add code in append                                         | Required if type is append | String                |

In addition, for variables referenced within text/template, you can convert to the following cases using the format .var | case.

| Name     | Case          |
| -------- | ------------- |
| camel    | camelCase     |
| snake    | snake_case    |
| kebab    | kebab-case    |
| dash     | dash-case     |
| dot      | dot.case      |
| proper   | ProperCase    |
| pascal   | PascalCase    |
| lower    | lower case    |
| sentence | Sentence case |
| constant | CONSTANT_CASE |
| title    | Title Case    |

> [!NOTE]
>
> By attaching OnlyAlphanumeric to the end of each case modifier (e.g. pascalOnlyAlphanumeric), if the first character of the string is **not alphanumeric**, it is excluded and the case is converted.
> For example, [projectId] is converted to ProjectId with pascalOnlyAlphanumeric.

The content consists of headings and code blocks as follows.

````md
---
actions:
  - type: "add"
    template: "page.tsx"
---

# page.tsx

```tsx
export const Page = (children: { children: React.ReactNode }) => <div>{children}</div>;
```
````

As mentioned earlier, the template of any element contained in actions needs to match the heading in the content.
The syntax of text/template can also be used for headings.

## Benchmarks

### Environment

- OS: macOS Monterey 12.6.3
- CPU: Apple M1 Max
- Memory: 64GB
- Node.js: 20.11.1
- npm: 10.5.1

We measured the time it took to generate a simple React component with each package.
The benchmark project is available [here](./benchmarks).

```tsx
import React from "react";

export const {{ name }}: React.FC = (children: { children: React.ReactNode }) => <div>{children}</div>;
```

### Result

| Package      | Version | Average time of 10 times(ms) |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| plop         | 6.2.11  | 0.233                        |
| scaffdog     | 3.0.0   | 0.385                        |
| **moldable** | 0.0.4   | 0.182                        |

Moldable is the fastest. This is because it is written in Go and executed by node after compiling it into a binary.
